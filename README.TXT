Description:

User starts out with a factor array of 10 and is level 0.

After the user enters their name, they are thrown into battle.

During battles the player gets to choose to attack or has a 
50% chance to run. If the user chooses to attack, the game 
randomly chooses a factor out of a number's array of factors 
(such as 4 from array of number 8 which countains {1, 2, 4, 8}) 
as the amount of damage to be inflicted on the opponent.

There is a 10% chance the player and enemy can hit criticals, 
giving a 2x damage multiplier on the hit, when the enemy does 
a critical they have the added effect of gaining some health.
The player also has the added 2% chance to hit the enemy's 
weak spot, producing a 3x damage multiplier. 

The enemies encountered will be random numbers from rank 1 to 100,
starting off low and increasing as the player levels up. The chance
of encountering prime numbers are greatly smaller than others. 

The experience and health per level will scales with the players level.

The ultimate goal is to defeat the evil number 100, which will have 
some special features. The player can continue to battle as long as
their is at least one number in their attack array.
