CSIS 10A (Java) Final 

# Final Project Ideas

## 1) Document Summary.
  Counts the amount of words, sentences, and paragraphs of a word document. The data per paragraph is gathered into "paragraph" objects, and: Paragraph[] allParagraphs = new Paragraph[determinedParagraphNumber]; will be made to store all the data. Possibly add the feature to find what word(s) were used the most, maybe even do a find and replace function. 

## 2) Battle Factors.
  This game randomly chooses a factor out of a number's array of factors (such as 4 from array of number 8 which countains {1, 2, 4, 8}) as the amount of damage to be inflicted on the opponent. The enemies encountered will be random numbers from 1 to 100, starting off low and increasing as the player levels up. The chance of encountering prime numbers are greatly smaller than others. The player gets to choose to attack or has a 50% chance to run in battle. The experience and health per level will scale with the players level (level 1 to 10), and has the ultimate goal of defeating the number 100, which will have some special features. 

## 3) Gridworld String Printer.
  The user can input a string including letters from the alphabet or numbers and a series of bugs will write out the string on the GUI. Maybe give the option to specify size and color.
