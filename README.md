CSIS 10A (Java) Final 

# Final Project Ideas

## 1) A Variance of 2048 game.

## 2) Document Summary.
  Counts the words, sentences, paragraphs, etc... of a word document. The data per paragraph is gathered into "paragraph" objects, and: Paragraph[] allParagraphs = new Paragraph[determinedParagraphNumber]; will be made to store all the data.


## 3) Gridworld String Printer.
  The user can input a string including letters from the alphabet or numbers and a series of bugs will write out the string on the GUI. Maybe give the option to specify size and color.
